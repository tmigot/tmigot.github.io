I posted on HAL a work in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Dussault, Mounir Haddou, and Abdeslam Kadrani on relaxation methods for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints and the approximate resolution of their sub-problems entitled : [How to Compute a Local Minimum of the MPCC](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01525402v1). I will present part of this work during the conference [EUROPT 2017 in Montr√©al](https://www.gerad.ca/colloques/europt2017/).
