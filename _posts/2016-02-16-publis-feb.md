I posted on HAL a work on a numerical method for the absolute value equation in collaboration with Lina Abdallah from Tripoli, Lebanon, and Mounir Haddou entitled: [Solving Absolute Value Equation using Complementarity and Smoothing Functions](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01217977). EDIT: The paper has been accepted in Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics (doi :10.1016/j.cam.2017.06.019).
