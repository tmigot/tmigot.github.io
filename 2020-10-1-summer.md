Two new publications in collaboration have been accepted this summer: [<i>On approximate stationary points of the regularized mathematical program with complementarity constraints</i>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-020-01706-w) in JOTA
and <i>The new butterfly relaxation method for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints</i> as a book chapter in the proceedings of the Indo-French seminar.
These works are constituting the theoretical basis for computing M-stationary points of the MPCC, more will come soon. I also continue to update the Julia code:

  * [MPCC.jl](https://github.com/tmigot/MPCC.jl) Set of tools to model the mathematical program with complementarity/switching/vanishing constraints and bilevel programs following the [NLPModels](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl) framework.
The package contains the basic tools to use the [Stopping.jl](https://github.com/vepiteski/Stopping.jl) framework.
  * [MPCCSolver.jl](https://github.com/tmigot/MPCCSolver.jl) Set of algorithms to solve models from MPCC.jl.

I also had the chance to present <i>A differential inclusion approach to mineral precipitation-dissolution reactions in geochemistry</i> in collaboration with Bastien Hamlat and Jocelyne Erhel in the [online Workshop Variational Methods in Nonlinear Phenomena](https://sites.google.com/view/vamenoph2020/home).
This work is part of Bastien's Ph.D. thesis who successfully defended this month, Congrats!
