Two publications have been accepted this summer: [<i>On approximate stationary points of the regularized mathematical program with complementarity constraints</i>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-020-01706-w) in JOTA and [The new butterfly relaxation method for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints]() in the proceedings of the Indo-French seminar.
These works are the theoretical basis toward the computation of M-stationary points of the MPCC. I also continue to update the Julia:
  * [MPCC.jl](https://github.com/tmigot/MPCC.jl) Set of tools to model the mathematical program with complementarity/switching/vanishing constraints following the [NLPModels](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl) structure and with basic tools to use the [Stopping](https://github.com/vepiteski/Stopping.jl) framework.
  * [MPCCSolver.jl](https://github.com/tmigot/MPCCSolver.jl) A set of algorithms to solve the models from MPCC.jl.
  
I also had the pleasure to present  <i>A differential inclusion approach to mineral precipitation-dissolution reactions in geochemistry</i> in collaboration with Jocelyne Erhel and Bastien Hamlat in the [online Workshop Variational Methods in Nonlinear Phenomena](https://sites.google.com/view/vamenoph2020/home).
This work is part of Bastien's Ph.D. thesis that he successfully defended this month, Congrats!!!
