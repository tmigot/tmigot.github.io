My research focuses on numerical optimization. I am interested in designing algorithms for nonsmooth optimization problems arising in sparse optimization and for non-convex problems, including mathematical programs with complementarity problems, bilevel optimization problems, and generalized Nash equilibrium problems.

I am also very fond of chess and a big fan of Stade Rennais FC!
