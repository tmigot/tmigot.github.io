I gave a talk entitled "Stopping.jl: A framework to implement iterative optimization algorithms" in the [Journées de l'optimisation 2019, Montréal, Québec](https://symposia.cirrelt.ca/JOPT2019/fr/home) in the session Optimization in Julia to introduce our new Julia package.

You can find the slides [here](../files/diapo_Stopping_JOPT_19.pdf) and the package is available here (for now):

[Stopping.jl](https://github.com/Goysa2/Stopping.jl)

This package is a set of tools to ease the uniformization of stopping criteria in iterative solvers.
