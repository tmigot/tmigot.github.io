I gave a couple of talks over the summer at the EURO conference [2019 EURO conference, Dublin, Ireland](https://www.euro2019dublin.com/) (and co-organize a stream on games with 18 talks!), the [2019 World Congress on Global Optimization, Metz, France](https://wcgo2019.event.univ-lorraine.fr), the [2019 ICCOPT, Berlin, Germany](https://iccopt2019.berlin/), the [MOPTA 2019, Lehigh, USA](http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~mopta/) and finally the [AMMCS-2019, Waterloo, Ontario](http://www.ammcs.wlu.ca/) (co-organize of a special session on optimization).
Now, back in Guelph for a second year and teach a new class this Fall.
