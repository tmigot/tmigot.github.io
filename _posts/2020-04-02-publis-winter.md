To celebrate the new year, I gave in January a seminar talk at the <a href="https://mathstat.uoguelph.ca/node/414">Departmental Colloquium Series</a> in Guelph where I motivated the GNEP and presented some of our findings with Monica Cojocaru. In particular, it was based on this new paper we got accepted
[<i>A dynamical system  approach to the generalized Nash equilibrium problem</i>](http://jnva.biemdas.com/archives/954) in the open access Journal of Nonlinear and Variational Analysis. The paper review the use of nonsmooth dynamical system to find generalized Nash equilibria. And the paper is available in open access.

In March, I was taking a break from the canadian winter in France. I gave two seminar talks at Séminaire d’Analyse non linéaire et Optimisation de l'Université d'Avignon and Séminaire du LAMPS de l'Université de Perpignan. Thank you to Térence Bayen and Florent Nacry for inviting me.

The rest of my trip was cancelled due to the covid-19 pandemic. We managed to maintain our workshop on games by turning it into an online event.
