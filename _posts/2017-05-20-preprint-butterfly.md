I posted on HAL a work on the butterfly relaxation method for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Dussault and Mounir Haddou entitled: [The New Butterfly Relaxation Methods for Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01525399v1).
