As part of my postdoc at [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/), I presented my work on solving PDE-constrained optimization problems in Julia during IVADO's annual conference, IVADO Digital October.
It was a 3min presentation, and a great challenge for such challenging problem! The video is now available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMKQTUfGkWw), and, as usual, more on the various packages on GitHub [@tmigot](https://github.com/tmigot).

The study of algorithms for optimization problems has become the backbone of data science and its multiple applications. Nowadays, new challenges involve ever-increasing amounts of data and model complexity. Examples include optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDE) that are frequent in imaging, signal processing, shape optimization, and seismic inversion. In this presentation, we showcase a new optimization infrastructure to model and solve PDE-constrained problems in the Julia programming language. We build upon the JuliaSmoothOptimizers infrastructure for modeling and solving continuous optimization problems, and present a collection of packages for PDE-constrained problems.
