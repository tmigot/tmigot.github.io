I taught a new course in Guelph this Fall, and in the meantime, 3 papers have been accepted.

* The first paper in a series on numerical methods for the GNEP:

T. Migot, M.-G. Cojocaru. [<i>A parametrized variational inequality approach to track the solution set of a generalized Nash equilibrium problem</i>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2019.11.054), European Journal of Operation Research, 2019.

* A work on the complexity of some ordering problems:

J. Omer, T. Migot. [<i>Vertex ordering with optimal number of adjacent predecessors</i>](https://dmtcs.episciences.org/5996), Discrete Mathematics \& Theoretical Computer Science, 2019.

* Finally, an optimal control formulation in a prophylactic treatment strategy for a predator-prey system:

M.-G. Cojocaru, T. Migot, and A. Jaber. [<i>Controlling infection in predator-prey systems with transmission dynamics</i>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2019.12.002), Infectious Disease Modelling, Vol. 5, 2020, pp. 1-11.

This work was the final chapter in Ahmed's thesis successfully defended, good luck for your future!
