Some news following our work with Dr. M. Cojocaru in Guelph with an 
[article on the website of the CEPS Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps/news/2021/01/mathematical-methods-changing-game)
presenting some nice applications of GNEPs.

In the meantime, we had two new papers accepted:
  * On a fun application of Minty variational inequalities in game theory:  
T. Migot, M.-G. Cojocaru. [<i>On Minty variational inequalities and evolutionary stable states of generalized stable games</i>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637720301875), Operations Research Letters, 49:1, pp. 96--100, 2021.
  * About a decomposition method for generalized games allowing us to use the nonlinear optimization solver to problems with a large number of players:  
T. Migot, M.-G. Cojocaru. [<i>A decomposition method for convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems</i>](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11081-020-09578-9), Optimization and Engineering, online, 2020, doi:10.1007/s11081-020-09578-9.
