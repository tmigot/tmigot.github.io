I gave a talk about the butterfly relaxation method for mathematical programs with complementarity constraints at the [INFORMS 2016 Annual Meeting](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/nashville2016/), which were organized in the city of music Nashville (Tennessee, US) from 14 to 16 of November 2016, see the [slides](files/diapo_MPCC_Butterfly.pdf).
