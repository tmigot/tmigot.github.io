I taught in french the class [MTH8408](https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/methodes-doptimisation-et-controle-optimal) *Méthodes d'optimisation et contrôle optimal* during the winter session at Polytechnique Montréal on numerical methods for optimization, variational calculus, and optimal control. 

The class was a lot of fun, and we had amazing session projets on: local warming, predictive control for wind power, game-theoretic formulation of environmental projects, optimal control of a quadrotor, and machine learning of alpha-decay half-lives.

We also covered Julia programming during the class. To give some pointers, the following resources was used:
- [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/): model optimization problems
- [NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl/): model optimization problems ([NLPModelsJuMP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModelsJuMP.jl/) convert JuMP to NLPModel)
- [PDENLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PDENLPModels.jl/): model optimal control and variational calculus
- [JSOSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSolvers.jl/): algorithms for unconstrained optimization and nonlinear least squares.
- [OptimizationProblems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/OptimizationProblems.jl/): learn Github workflow, model optimization problem, benchmark.
