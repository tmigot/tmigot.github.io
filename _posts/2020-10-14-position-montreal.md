I am starting a new postdoc position in Polytechnique Montr√©al with [Dominique Orban](https://dpo.github.io/) on solvers for optimization problems involving PDE constraints in Julia and data science applications.
This new position is funded by a competitive grant of [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/), the institute for data valorization in Montreal.
