I was in the organizing committee of the conference [HJ2016: Hamilton-Jacobi Equations: new trends and applications](http://hj2016.sciencesconf.org/), which takes place from 30 May to 3 June 2016 in Rennes (France). I also presented there a poster on: "A new relaxation method for the mathematical program with complementarity constraints."
