I showed how to use JuliaSmoothOptimizers framework to PDE-constrained optimization problems modeled with [PDENLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PDENLPModels.jl) at this year's [JuliaCon 2022/JuMP-dev 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022). The conference featured three talks on JuliaSmoothOptimizers in the [JuMP-dev](https://jump.dev/meetings/juliacon2022/) stream.

Dominique Orban gave a complete overview in 25 minutes (!!) of the JuliaSmoothOptimizers organization. The talk mentions all the key packages to model optimization problems ([NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl) & Co), solve models ([JSOSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSolvers.jl) & Co) and do simple yet amazing benchmarks with [SolverBenchmark.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSolvers.jl).

Geoffroy Leconte presented [RipQP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/RipQP.jl) a multi-precision algorithm for convex quadratic optimization. The multi-precision feature illustrates the strength of pure Julia implementations, and ensuing performance.

You can re-watch the three talks on Youtube:
