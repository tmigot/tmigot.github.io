I gave a talk about interior point methods for monotone linear complementarity problems at the [Journ√©es SMAI-MODE 2016](http://mode2016.sciencesconf.org/), which were organized in Toulouse from 23 to 25 of March 2016, see the 						[slides](http://mode2016.sciencesconf.org/85064). You can find a preprint of this work [on HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01355566). <B>UPDATE</B> Jan. 2018: the paper has been accepted in Optimization Letters (doi: 10.1007/s11590-018-1241-2).
