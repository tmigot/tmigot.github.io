My research focus on numerical optimization. I am interested in designing algorithms for nonsmooth optimization problems arising in sparse optimization and for non-convex problems including mathematical programs with complementarity problems, bilevel optimization problems and generalized Nash equilibrium problems. I have defended my thesis in October 2017 under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Dussault and Mounir Haddou.

I am also very fond of chess and a big fan of Stade Rennais FC!
